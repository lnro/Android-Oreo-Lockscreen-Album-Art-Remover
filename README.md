Oreo Lock Screen Album Art Remover
==========
* Note: This is the first time I've ever used Github, and Android Studio!!!!!
* I have no clue what was needed to be done, but the SDK level had to be bumped up to target SDK 33. The application still has a min SDK level of 26 to support 8.0/.1.

Are you tired of Android Oreo's lockscreen wallpaper changing constantly during media playback? 
Fear no more, this module will help YOU combat horribly pixelated album art from taking over your beautiful lockscreen!
